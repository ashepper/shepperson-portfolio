# Government Debt Data Visualizations

Below are three visualizations that all use the same [government debt data](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm) from the OECD. The data includes Debt-to-GDP ratios (total general government debt as a percentage of GDP) from 34 different countries spanning the years 1995 - 2020. Below, I experiment with a couple of free, on-line tools for creating quick and easy visualizations. 

<i><b>Data Source:</b> OECD (2021), General government debt (indicator). doi: 10.1787/a0528cc2-en (Accessed on 13 September 2021)</i>

## Visualization 1: OECD Website Tool
This first visualization simply uses the chart tool provided on the OECD website. This simple tool is quite intuitive; you can scroll to a desired year, highlight specific countries, and choose between visualizing data over time in four different formats. While the tool is simple and quick, there is not too much room for customization. Users cannot alter colors or anything outside of the type of chart and the data they want to display. Any further customization would require a more advanced tool.

I chose to highlight the United States, to get the reader thinking about where the United States falls in relation to other countries. A simple highlight (red) of the US serves this purpose. Many of the presets for the tool are designed to create a clean visualization. For example, in the bar chart format, the bars are ascending from lowest to highest. This makes it easy for the reader to see where a given country falls compared to the other countries in the data.

## Visualization 2: Flourish Sparklines
Here, I visualize the same data in a 'sparkline' format using the online tool [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/). Flourish adds more customization capabilities than the OECD website tool, but users are still limited in what they can do. In this format, for example, it seemed you could only label the axis in a repeating format rather than just once. For this reason, I chose not to label the axis and instead conveyed the necessary information in the title of the visualization.

The data in this sparkline format is good for comparing trends over time across countries. The format makes it easy to see if any countries saw similar uptiks or drops in their Debt-to-GDP ratios at around the same time, and how countries vary in their overall trajectory. 

I chose to visualize the Debt-to-GDP ratio in a reddish color to indicate that what we are looking at is "bad." Because of some of the automatic formatting of of the axis in Flourish, I made sure that the title clearly states what the visualization is showing.

## Visualization 3: Flourish Heatmap
Lastly, I visualized the data again in Flourish in a heatmap format. I thought this could be a good way to more clearly see the extent or severity of government debt and its change over time. I also thought it could be a clearer way to compare the debt levels between countries. It becomes clear from this graph the extent of Japan's Dept-to-GDP ration in comarison to other countries. We also notice that with a few small exceptions, no country seems to be decreasing their Debt-to-GDP ratio. 

I chose to visualize the Debt-to-GDP ratio in reds with the darker reds indicating higher rations. This is meant to communicate severity, whereas the lighter colors indicate lower rations.
