# Final Project Proposal: Abortion Access & Public Opinion in the United States
In this project, Iâ€™m interested creating a narrative around abortion access and public opinion on abortion in the United States. My theory is that public opinion does not accurately reflect the laws and regulations being put into place in many states. In the narrative and visualizations I create, I hope to demonstrate the disparity between what the voting population believes, and the increasing number of restrictions being enacted across the country. I hope that this will inspire legislators to take action to preserve access to abortion as a universal right in the United States.
