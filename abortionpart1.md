# Final Project Proposal: Abortion Access & Public Opinion in the United States
In this project, I’m interested creating a narrative around abortion access and public opinion on abortion in the United States. My theory is that public opinion does not accurately reflect the laws and regulations being put into place in many states. In the narrative and visualizations I create, I hope to demonstrate the disparity between what the voting population believes, and the increasing number of restrictions being enacted across the country. I hope that this will inspire legislators to take action to preserve access to abortion as a universal right in the United States.

## The Data
### Public Opinion
With this data, I hope to be able to portray general attitudes and approaches to thinking about abortion in the United States. What other issues do people who care about abortion care about? What do they believe in? Where do they live? 

[Public Opinion on Abortion by State, Abortion Laws Enacted](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/01/21/do-state-laws-on-abortion-reflect-public-opinion/) (Pew Research) - 2020)

### Characteristics of People Getting Abortions
This will help me paint a picture of who is getting aboritons in the United States. Where is the overlap with the public opinion data? Where do they live, what is their income? Can we discern anything about why they are getting abortions? Does that matter? (No!) Have these characteristics changed over time?

### Data on Abortion Policies
Below is some data and methodology on abortion policies. Here, I hope to be able to map out where the most restrictive versus where the most liberal policies are. This will help us see the overlap between who needs abortions, who is getting abortions, and where the most restrictive policies are occuring.

### Data on effects of policies
I would like to find more data sources in this area. However, this is a preliminary example of how we can talk about the effects of policies, and who they will impact. Are those that are most vocal against aboriton also those who will be most affected by the policies?

### State - Level Data
I’m sure there are other states that would be more appropriate to use, but Washington had such a nice trove of organized data I thought I’d include it here.

[Washington State Abortion Data](https://www.doh.wa.gov/DataandStatisticalReports/HealthStatistics/AbortionPregnancy) (just because lots of it and well organized!)

## Method and Medium

My final project will be an interactive story website built using Shorthand. Users will be able to scroll through the story and data. Many of the data visualizations will be built with Tableau and/or Flourish. If possible, I would love to experiment with doing some data visualizations in R. I’m interested in developing this skill and the capabilities of the software are appealing.

I’ll need to learn more about embedding R visualizations into Shorthand, and if there is a way to do that and retain some of the interactive features available in ie. the plot.ly package in R.
