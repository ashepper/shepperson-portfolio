Hey there! This here is my public portfolio for the course <i>Telling Stories with Data</i> at  Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University. The work on this page was done in the Fall of 2021.

## About Me
Hi! My name is Anna Shepperson, I’m a second year Public Policy and Management student at Heinz College. I grew up in the Hudson River valley in New York, but since 2010 have been bouncing back and forth between Pittsburgh and NYC.

Prior to Heinz, I worked for several years in Pittsburgh-based non-profits, mostly working with and advocating for immigrant communities here in Western PA. Most recently I was the project manager at All for All, a local initiative that was created to hold the region accountable for implementing its immigrant inclusion plan. There, I worked closely with the Mayor’s Office and other regional stakeholders to get programs and initiatives off the ground to make the region more accessible for foreign-born residents. Currently, I’m interning at New American Economy, a NY-based immigration research and advocacy organization.

In my free time, you can find me working on my “fixer-upper” house in Pittsburgh, hiking and spending time outside, or at [Pullproof Studio](https://www.pullproof.studio/), an artist co-working space and printmaking studio I (along with several friends) run in the Garfield neighborhood of Pittsburgh. 

## What I Learned
This course has been an excellent way to learn tools for integrating my visual tendencies with my career goals in public policy and advocacy. It helped me get a sense of what tools are out there for visualizing data. It was also a great way for me to practice storyboarding and wireframing.

Below is some of the work I did as part of the course!

### Visualizing Government Debt 
:chart_with_upwards_trend:
[Here](/dataviz2.md) is a blog post documenting how I use several data viz methods and tools to test out how to best visualize [government debt data](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.html).

### Critiquing a Visualization of Abortion Trends
:scissors:
[Here](/abortioncrit.md) I talk about what is an isn't working in [this](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2017/01/18/the-abortion-rate-in-america-falls-to-its-lowest-level-since-roe-v-wade) graph from <i>The Economist</i> visualizing abortion trends in the United States.

### Visualizing a Story about Abortion Access in Texas
:pencil2: 
For my final project as part of the course, I collected and analyzed data on abortion access and prevalence in the United States. I used the opportunity to tell a story about how and why you should support abortion seekers in Texas. Below, I detail my process of coming up with the story and collecting data, making initial sketches and getting feedback, and finally piecing it all together into a website. The completed project can be found:

##### [Part 1](/abortionpart1.md)
:bulb: 
In Part 1, I walk through the first phase of story development including coming up with the idea, collecting initial datasets and sources, and outlining a story.

##### [Part 2](/abortionpart2.md)
:interrobang: 
In Part 2, I dive deeper into story development, including making some sketches and initial storyboards and doing user research.

##### [Part 3](/abortionpart3.md)
:jigsaw: 
In Part 3, I make some final edits and changes to the storyline, and piece it all together into a final product.
