    <td>What are your main takeaway(s) from this piece?</td>
    <td>not as staunch as I believe my stance on the issue is
</td>
    <td>+main point is that people need access to abortion whether you make it illegal or not
+essential reproductive healthcare and a very small part of it
+effects low income ppl and minorities disproportionately
</td>
	<td>+first page lays out premise. Then you talk about why -- facts and whats happening as a result of the changes in the law</td>

    <td>Is there anything surprising or confusing?</td>
    <td>+ 75% ppl get abortions are low income. why?</td>
    <td>+out of state visualization is confusing
+wording was a bit weird some places
+interesting paid out of pocket point
+who is that red block southern baptists?
</td>
<td>+53% pay out of pocket, how do you pay if not out of pocket
+texas and mississippi. Poor folks!
+texas graphic is confusing. Red line breaks the square. Just have second half, just show how many people now need to go out of state. Percentage of people that now get aboriton will have to go out of state. Important but need to show it differently.
+ “100% more likely  to die in childbirth for Black women” is confusing wording. 
+ I like the hand drawn ones! They are easier and more direct in a way
+ interesting that opinions and state laws don’t align. Texas is so screwed up.
