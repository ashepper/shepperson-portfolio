# Draft Storyboard: Abortion Access in the United States

### All across the country, people are being denied access to necessary medical procedures.
<i> [talk about latest laws in Texas, Mississippi] </i>

### Abortion is Common, Widespread, and Necessary

### Most Adults in the United States Believe Abortion Should be Legal and Accessible

### However, Opinions Vary by State

### Regardless, Opinions do not Always Align with State Regulations, and Many Fall Through the Cracks

### Case Study: Texas

<i> [ Several weeks ago, the Supreme Court let stand a Texas law that essentially enables anyone -- vigilante law enforcement -- to enforce the abortion ban. The law makes Roe functionally dead.  Private citizens are enabled by the state to investigate anyone who they believe might have taken part or aided in an abortion past the six week stage. [1] ]</i>

### Who Restrictions Affect the Most

<i> [If states wanted to invest in mothers and children, they would invest in adequate maternal care. The numbers show that this is not a priority, especially for Black women.] </i>

# User Research & Interviews
For my research, I showed participants the draft images and graphs represented above. I included the major headings, but did not include any of the more in depth text. I decided to omit text because of the likelihood that users will look at the final product only briefly, and I wanted to gather the “main takeaways” of the user. 

My target audience for this project started out as those who are generally “pro-choice,” but either take abortion access for granted, or who have not taken any actions to ensure that abortion is safeguarded as a right. The aim of the site will be to make a tool that will help people funnel their beliefs into action. 

After talking to users during the research phase, I may alter the intended audience and goal slightly which I will talk about below. In my original proposal, the audience is those who would like to be more politically engaged around issues of aboriton but may not know how. Colloquially, I find that many who fall into this group identify as male, though not all. For this group, I targeted mostly men in their 20s - 70s who I know generally support the right to choose but who are not outwardly politically active on the issue.

After interviewing these individuals I decided that it would be beneficial to interview several users who are intimately familiar with the subject matter, and could have valuable insight into additional statistics, facts, and topics that should be included in the presentation that I may have missed. For this, I interviewed a Maternal-Child nurse who works with low-income new mothers on a daily basis, as well as an individual who has been involved in pro-choice activism for some years on a national scale.

## Changes to Plan to Address Issues Identified
Going into the feedback and user experience process, I knew I wanted to add more information, but was not sure how users would take the information given, and where they would want to go with it. One common point of feedback among almost all users was that the information and ideas behind those being “left behind” or “falling through the cracks” due to more restrictive abortion measures needed to be fleshed out more. Why do Black women die at higher rates during childbirth? How can I more concretely relate this back to abortion access?

In order to address this, I hope to more concretely relate abortion access to the idea that if more restrictive states actually cared about “life --” that is, maternal outcomes, child poverty, they would invest in mothers and children. Instead, they are taking a punitive approach that does not help mothers, but rather harms them. In order to do this I will look at data such as investment in programs such as WIC, child poverty rates, and maternal outcomes in Texas specifically.

There were some great smaller and very achievable suggestions, such as adding information about what the ‘baseline’ abortion laws are at a federal level, as well the number (or percentage) of abortions people are seeking by state. If Texas has the highest number of abortions of any state, why is that? How and does this relate to the extremely restrictive measures being put into place? Additionally, many found the chart depicting where Texans do and will have to go to get aboritons confusing. I will find another way of depicting this information, such as through a bar chart or other more digestible format appropriate for a broader audience.

Another good suggestion was to flesh out how new regulations will affect pregnant people. What does crossing state lines mean for those seeking aboritons financially, emotionally, and in their outcomes? Can this be tied into more socioeconomic outcomes?

Some suggestions could be interesting but I am on the fence about, such as adding international views on aboriton as a comparison, and more context and information on the background of the anti-aboriton movement and its progression over time.  These are aspects I believe I could add with more time and in a different context, but I am not sure about the importance of them in this project.

Overall, there seemed to be some confusion on the audience of the piece. Given some of the feedback I received, I found it may be beneficial to narrow down the audience further, and that the piece might be most effective if it were targeting those who are “on the fence” about aboriton, but are open minded and willing to have conversations about it. In order to do this, it was suggested that I add more figures and statistics on the effects of both not being able to access abortion, as well as what the impacts of the ‘calls to action’ would be.
