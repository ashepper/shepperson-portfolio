### Case Study: Texas

<i> [ Several weeks ago, the Supreme Court let stand a Texas law that essentially enables anyone -- vigilante law enforcement -- to enforce the abortion ban. The law makes Roe functionally dead.  Private citizens are enabled by the state to investigate anyone who they believe might have taken part or aided in an abortion past the six week stage. [1] ]</i>

### Who Restrictions Affect the Most

<i> [If states wanted to invest in mothers and children, they would invest in adequate maternal care. The numbers show that this is not a priority, especially for Black women.] </i>

# User Research & Interviews
For my research, I showed participants the draft images and graphs represented above. I included the major headings, but did not include any of the more in depth text. I decided to omit text because of the likelihood that users will look at the final product only briefly, and I wanted to gather the “main takeaways” of the user. 

My target audience for this project started out as those who are generally “pro-choice,” but either take abortion access for granted, or who have not taken any actions to ensure that abortion is safeguarded as a right. The aim of the site will be to make a tool that will help people funnel their beliefs into action. 

After talking to users during the research phase, I may alter the intended audience and goal slightly which I will talk about below. In my original proposal, the audience is those who would like to be more politically engaged around issues of aboriton but may not know how. Colloquially, I find that many who fall into this group identify as male, though not all. For this group, I targeted mostly men in their 20s - 70s who I know generally support the right to choose but who are not outwardly politically active on the issue.

After interviewing these individuals I decided that it would be beneficial to interview several users who are intimately familiar with the subject matter, and could have valuable insight into additional statistics, facts, and topics that should be included in the presentation that I may have missed. For this, I interviewed a Maternal-Child nurse who works with low-income new mothers on a daily basis, as well as an individual who has been involved in pro-choice activism for some years on a national scale.
