# Telling a Story with Data: Compiling and Visualizing a Story about Abortion Access in Texas.

Over the past few weeks, I’ve been gathering data and sketching out a visual and written story about abortion access in the United States, and then specifically in Texas. The final product can be viewed [here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/texas-takes-onpersonal-liberties/index.html).

Below, I’ve outlined the work that went into creating the final website. This included collecting data, drafting sketches of visuals to depict the data, and crafting a narrative to spur people into action. Throughout this process I did user interviews, re-drafted, rearranged, did more sketches, and eventually compiled the work together into the website.

## Previous Work

<b>Phase 1:</b>  For more information on the first phase of story development, including coming up with the idea, collecting initial datasets and sources, and outlining a story, please refer to [here](https://ashepper.github.io/shepperson-portfolio/abortionpart1.html).

<b>Phase 2:</b>  For a deeper look into the second phase of story development, including some sketches and initial storyboards, as well as user research and findings, see [here](https://ashepper.github.io/shepperson-portfolio/abortionpart2.html).

## Phase 3: 
### Piecing it All Together

I found this portion of the process to be the hardest, perhaps because I hadn’t done my due diligence to piece together my story enough in Part 2. After getting feedback from users about what parts of the story were missing, I had another round of data collection to see what was actually achievable. Once I had some new sources, I began making visuals. Several hours in I felt just as lost as when I had started, and realized that I needed to take a step back and re-map out the information I had and how I could piece it together to tell a story.

This involved writing all the statistics I had on notecards, and arranging them in a way that the story began to make sense. This helped me eliminate information that didn’t quite fit with the story, and find new ways to fit the information together. Doing this helped me realize that the story should, and could, focus more on Texas. 

This was one of the main points of feedback from the user research I did -- that the story was really broad -- and it seemed like most of the users were trying to suggest new information that could contextualize what I had at the time. With the data I had (and also influenced by current events), I decided to focus on Texas, which significantly narrowed the scope of my work and helped me focus on what data would actually contribute in putting together a convincing narrative. With Texas as my subject focus, I decided to narrow my audience to those who are already sympathetic to the plight for abortion access, but may not be knowledgeable or aware of what is happening in Texas.  My call to action and goals suddenly felt a lot more clear.

### Final Round of Drafting

Once I had my story in place, I got to sketching again, this time with more of a storyboard technique. When I had done my sketches in the earlier iterations of the project, I had mostly put pieces of information together without thinking enough (I realize now) about how they flowed. Making these sketches gave me a whole lot more direction once I actually went back to Shorthand, Flourish, and the other tools I was using. I had a purpose and could clearly see what graphics I had to make.

### Making it Mesh
Once the initial graphics were done, I set out trying to make everything “look good.” I took inspiration from one of the mood boards I had completed earlier (see [phase 2 page](https://ashepper.github.io/shepperson-portfolio/abortionpart2.html) for more), and decided to base the aesthetic of the project off of protest signs. I used marker on paper to create all the illustrations for the piece. It’s subtle for sure, but it was my small nod to the cardboard and paper signs so many people have used to express their concerns and opinions about abortion in the streets and at protests.

I struggled a bit with the color scheme, as I did not want to do bright red and blue, as it is too reminiscent of political parties. While these FOR SURE play a role here, that wasn’t the conversation I wanted to focus on. I used adobe’s color tool to find a color scheme that had some subtler tones. I wound up with a more purple blue and an orangy-pink red which I thought toned down the intensity a little bit, but didn’t feel to “feminine” (I wanted to steer away from this being a “woman’s issue.”)

In the end, I wound up with a 'vibe' that I feel reflected the tone I was aiming for. I wanted to pay homage to the more 'DIY' activism and work being done around abortion care, but also provide clear and concise hitory and statistics to those who wanted to digest information quickly. I think the shorthand website was a good platoform for accomplishing this.
